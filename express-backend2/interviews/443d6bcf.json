You're absolutely right - when you run `print(\"Hello World\")`, you'll see \"Hello World\" in your terminal. \n\nSince you understand this basic concept, let's explore a bit further. In Python, what do you think would happen if you changed the double quotes to single quotes, like this: `print('Hello World')`? Would this still work the same way?"

This is a great observation about Python's flexibility.\n\nLet me ask you this: What if you wanted to print a message that contains both single and double quotes, like: `I said \"Hello\" to my friend's mom`? How would you handle printing this entire sentence in Python?"

F-strings are indeed very useful for string formatting, but let me ask you this: If you wanted to print the exact sentence `I said \"Hello\" to my friend's mom` (which contains both double quotes and a single quote), could you show me how you would actually write the print statement? Would you use f-strings for this specific case, and if so, how?"
