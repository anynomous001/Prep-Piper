      "content": "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.It forms the backbone of every webpage, often paired with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.I used HTML effectively in a personal portfolio project, where I built a responsive multi-page site to showcase my development skills.It included semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.The project integrated images, forms, and navigation menus, giving a professional and user-friendly experience."
    },
    {
      "role": "interviewer",
      "content": "That's a great example of using semantic HTML! Since you mentioned using semantic tags for accessibility and SEO in your portfolio, can you walk me through how you would structure the HTML for a navigation menu that includes a logo, three main links, and a mobile hamburger menu - specifically focusing on which semantic elements you'd choose and why?"
    },
    {
      "role": "candidate",
      "content": "I'd wrap the entire navigation in a `<header>` element since it represents introductory content or site navigation.Inside it, I'd use a `<nav>` element to semantically indicate the main navigation section.The logo would be wrapped in an `<a>` tag (inside `<div>` or `<span>`), usually with the site name in an `<h1>` for branding and SEO.The three main links would go in an unordered list `<ul>` with each link inside a `<li>` and `<a>` for semantic structure and accessibility.The mobile hamburger menu could be a `<button>` with an accessible label (`aria-label=\"Open menu\"`), ensuring it's usable for screen readers.Example:```html<header>  <nav>    <a href=\"/\" class=\"logo\">      <h1>MyPortfolio</h1>    </a>    <ul>      <li><a href=\"#about\">About</a></li>      <li><a href=\"#projects\">Projects</a></li>      <li><a href=\"#contact\">Contact</a></li>    </ul>    <button aria-label=\"Open menu\" class=\"hamburger\">â˜°</button>  </nav></header>```"

      "role": "interviewer",
      "content": "Great structure! I can see you're thinking about accessibility with the `aria-label` and semantic elements. Since you mentioned the mobile hamburger menu, let's dive into the CSS side - can you show me how you would write the CSS to make this navigation responsive? Specifically, how would you hide the regular menu and show the hamburger button on mobile screens, and what CSS properties would you use to achieve a clean mobile-first responsive design?"

      "content": "That's perfectly fine! Let's take a step back - since you're familiar with the HTML structure we just discussed, can you show me how you would write just the basic CSS to style the navigation horizontally on desktop screens? Focus on making the logo, navigation links, and hamburger button appear in a single row, and don't worry about the mobile responsive part yet."

Imagine you're building a contact form for a website, and users are complaining that when they submit the form, they don't know if it went through successfully or if there was an error. How would you approach solving this problem to improve the user experience?"
    },
    {
      "role": "candidate",
      "content": "I would add some kind of message or notification to let users know what happened. Maybe show a green message saying 'Form submitted successfully' when it works, and a red message with an error when something goes wrong. I could also disable the submit button after they click it so they don't accidentally submit multiple times. I'm not sure exactly how to implement it with code, but I think the idea would be to show clear feedback to the user."

    {
      "role": "interviewer",
      "content": "That's a good approach! You're thinking about user feedback and preventing multiple submissions. Let me give you another scenario: You've built your portfolio website and you notice that it loads very slowly on mobile devices. Users are leaving before the page fully loads. What steps would you take to investigate and solve this performance issue?"
    },
    {
      "role": "candidate",
      "content": "I think the main issue would be the images being too large. I would try to compress the images or use smaller versions for mobile. Maybe I could also remove some unnecessary things that make the page heavy. I'm not sure about the technical details, but I would look into making the files smaller and maybe load the most important content first so users see something quickly even if the whole page isn't ready yet."
